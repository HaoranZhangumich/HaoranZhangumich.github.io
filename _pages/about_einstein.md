<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

I am a Master’s student in Computer Science at the University of Michigan, advised by Prof. Chad Jenkins. Before that, I completed my bachelor’s degrees in Computer Science and Data Science, also at the University of Michigan. I previously had the opportunity to work as a research intern in the CLeAR Lab at the National University of Singapore, advised by Prof. Harold Soh, and I am currently collaborating remotely with Shanghai AI Lab under the supervision of Xudong Xu. My research interests lie in robot learning, robot manipulation, and the development of benchmarks and simulation tools for evaluating robotic and intelligent systems.
