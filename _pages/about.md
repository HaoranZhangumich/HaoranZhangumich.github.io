I am a Master’s student in Computer Science at the University of Michigan, advised by Prof. Chad Jenkins. Before that, I completed my bachelor’s degrees in Computer Science and Data Science, also at the University of Michigan. I previously had the opportunity to work as a research intern in the CLeAR Lab at the National University of Singapore, advised by Prof. Harold Soh, and I am currently collaborating remotely with Shanghai AI Lab under the supervision of Xudong Xu. My research interests lie in robot learning, robot manipulation, and the development of benchmarks and simulation tools for evaluating robotic and intelligent systems.
